# Perceptron
C# Project using a Perceptron to calculate a much more accurate Line of Best Fit than with regular hill climbing

## How To Use
When the program is run, there are different options shown on the form.  To calculate the line of best fit, first you need to add points.  Enter the x and y values of several points and click add point.  Once the desired points are added, click reset perceptron to set up the perceptron.  Enter a number in the training textbox for how many times you want the perceptron to be trained.  Click train and you should see the equation that was generated from that amount of training.  You can keep training it and it will gradually get closer to the target equation.
